# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

Added the weather description to the weather data I already retrieved in this module. Then, I have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, I created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

## Deliverable 1

Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. Add column
Weather description. Create new dataframe and export the DataFrame as a CSV file. 

## Deliverable 2

Import the WeatherPy_Database.csv file from your Weather_Database folder from Deliverable 1 as a DataFrame. Write two input statements that prompt the user to enter their minimum and maximum temperature criteria for their vacation. Retrieve hotel data from API call. Add data to pop up markers.

## Deliverable 3

Use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.![Screen Shot 2021-08-08 at 10 01 20 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86200136/128634646-583cef49-a4c2-4380-b49c-3c2adcd8cb44.png)
